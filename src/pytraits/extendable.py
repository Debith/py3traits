def extendable(target):
    """
    Decorator that adds function for object to be extended using traits.

    NOTE: The 'add_traits' function this extendable decorator adds contains
          behavior that differs from usual function behavior. This method
          alters its behavior depending is the function called on a class
          or on an instance. If the function is invoked on class, then the
          class gets updated by the traits, affecting all new instances
          created from the class. On the other hand, if the function is invoked
          on an instance, only that instance gets the update, NOT whole class.

          See complete example from:
          pytraits/examples/extendable_function_class_vs_instance.py
