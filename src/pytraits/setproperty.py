    """
    Convinience function that dynamically creates property to an object.
    (If you have property created, just use 'add_traits')

    This function has different behavior depending on the target object,
    whether it is an instance or a class. If target is an instance the
    property is being set only for that instance. In case the object is
    a class, the property will be added to it normally to class.

    Args:
        target (object or type): Target object, which can be any instance or class.
        fget (str or function): Getter function or its name
        fset (str or function): Setter function or its name
        fdel (str or function): Deleter function or its name
        source (object or type): Source object in case fget, fset and fdel are strings.

    Keyword args:
        name (str): Name of the property
        name of fget (str): Name of the property

    Example, where new property is added dynamically into instance:

    >>> class Example:
    ...     def __init__(self):
    ...         self.__value = 42
    ...
    ...     def set_value(self, new_value):
    ...         self.__value = new_value
    ...
    ...     def value(self):
    ...         return self.__value
    ...
    ...     def del_value(self):
    ...         self.__value = 42
    ...
    >>> instance = Example()
    >>> setproperty(instance, "value", "set_value", "del_value", name="my_property")
    >>> instance.my_property
    42
