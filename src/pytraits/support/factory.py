    This class contains multiple ways to hold and create instances of classes.
    This class also works as a container for all those classes that are
    registered in and can those classes can be accessed from anywhere by simply
    importing that factory.

    The main mechanism in python to create and initialize objects are __new__
    and __init__ functions. It is also a good habit to avoid any conditional
    logic inside class constructor, thus writing own create classmethod is
    recommended and also supported by this factory. By using own class method
    for creating the object, it makes far more easier to setup and test classes
    you write since the __init__ method is left for simple assignments.

    NOTE: This factory is abstract thus anyone using it must inherit own
          version before instantiating it.
